// For each of the questions below, answer the questionâ€™s with this array:
// 1. Using a loop, iterate through this array and console.log all of the people.
// 2. Write the command to remove "Greg" from the array.
// 3. Write the command to remove "James" from the array.
// 4. Write the command to add "Matt" to the front of the array.
// 5. Write the command to add your name to the end of the array.
// 6. Using a loop, iterate through this array and after console.log-ing "Mary",
// exit from the loop.
// 7. Write the command to make a copy of the array using slice. The copy
// should NOT include "Mary" or "Matt".
// 8. Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Mary" is located.
// 9. Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Foo" is located (this
// should return -1).
// 10. Redefine the people variable with the value you started with. Using the
// splice command, remove "Devon" from the array and add "Elizabeth"
// const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];
// and "Artie". Your array should look like this when you are done ["Greg",
// "Mary", "Elizabeth", "Artie", "James"].
// 11. Create a new variable called withBob and set it equal to the people
// array concatenated with the string of "Bob".

const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

    console.log(i);

people.shift();
people.pop();

for (let i of people) {

}

const arr = people.slice(2);
people.indexOf("Mary");
people.indexOf("Foo");

people.splice(2, 1, "Elizabeth", "Artie");
const withBob = people.concat(["Bob"]);
